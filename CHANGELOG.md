### 🛠️Changes

- Fix a _very old_, known-issue with **dirt paths** and **farmlands**. [**[#1]**](https://github.com/UltimatChamp/BetterGrassify/issues/1)
  - This will only work when there is a dirt block below.
  - And yes, this is very much hard-coded, which I, initially, wanted to avoid.
  - `Dirt Paths` and `Farmlands` options are now enabled by default.
